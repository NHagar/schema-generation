This app uses AI to help you extract structured data from documents. Here's how it works:

1. **Upload a document** - Supports PDF files (max 10 pages)
2. **Select pages** - Choose which pages you want to process
3. **Define your schema** - You have two options:
   - Edit the default schema directly in the code editor
   - Click 'Generate Schema' to automatically create one based on your selected pages
4. **Extract data** - The app will process your document according to the schema
5. **Download results** - Get your structured data as a JSON file

The schema defines what data to extract and how to structure it. It uses Python's Pydantic library for data validation.
