Modify the provided Pydantic model class according to the specific constraints listed below.

- Remove any model fields from the provided Pydantic model.
- Represent any fields of type `datetime` or other date types as strings.
- Move any helper classes and nest them within the primary model class.
- Wrap any references to helper classes in double quotes (`"HelperClass"`).
- Remove any example data or example code within the model.
- Remove any default values and constraints for the fields.
- Remove any Pydantic `Config` or similar configurations.

# Steps

1. **Remove Fields**: Completely remove the fields attributes from the given model, leaving only the class structure.
2. **Convert Date Fields**: For fields dealing with date types, replace their type with `str`.
3. **Nest Helper Classes**: Any helper classes in the model should be nested within the primary model class to showcase their relationship.
4. **Wrap Helper References**: If the fields refer to helper classes as types, wrap these types in quotation marks.
5. **Sanitize Example Data**: Remove any example assignments given to fields or for the class.
6. **Remove Default Values and Constraints**: If fields contain default values, constraints, or Pydantic-specific attributes, completely remove them to create a simplified model.
7. **Remove Config Classes/Methods**: Any Pydantic configuration classes or methods should be removed entirely.

# Output Format

Provide the updated Python class as a Pydantic model, formatted in a readable manner without additional explanation or comments.
